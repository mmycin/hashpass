# Benchmark

This is a simple benchmarking script that measures the performance of the hashpass command-line tool. It runs the tool multiple times with different rounds and saves the results to a CSV file. The script also generates a plot of the benchmark results.

## Usage

To run the benchmark, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/benchmark` directory.
3. Run the `benchmark.sh` script.

The script will run the benchmark and generate the necessary files in the `/plots` directory. The CSV file will be saved in the `/plots` directory, and the plot will be saved in the `/result` directory.
